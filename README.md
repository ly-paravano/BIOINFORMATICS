# BIOINFORMATICS FINAL: GENETIC TESTING IN SPORTS

*Rachel Williamson, Luca Paravano*



## Set Up

The professional sports industry is a nearly $500 billion dollar industry, with many teams easily reaching over a billion dollar net worth just on their own (CITE Torrens). Much of this money comes from TV licensing, ad revenue, and apparel sales, with teams with bigger fan bases able tod drum up more money. What enables the New England Patriots, six time Super Bowl winners, to have a networth of $3.8 billion, or Real Madrid, 13 time Champions League winners to earn $4.24 billion? What results in a fan base that can bring in over a billion dollars? The players. Star players and overall talent across the board leads to entertaining games and more wins. More wins leads to more fans, and more fans lead to more money. (Let’s ignore the Dallas Cowboys, who, as the richest professional sports team in the world with a networth of $5 billion dollars, have not won a Super Bowl since 1996).	If team revenue relies on player ability, how can a coaching staff pick players that will be stars? This is where genetic testing comes in. Researchers have discovered genetic markers that seem to influence athletic ability, through things such as enhanced aerobic capacity and strength. In particular, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be correlated with different aspects of athletic success. Variations have been found within the ACE and ACTN3 genes that seem to give the individual’s carrying the variation increased power and and endurance (CITE NCBI). Other SNPs have been found to effect oxygen delivery, motor skills, and overall fitness. There is an obvious benefit to being able to predict an athlete’s ability simply from looking at their genes. A coach may choose to draft a player with the SNP that is linked with increased endurance over a player without that SNP, in the hopes that they will be able to play longer in games.	Additionally, genetic tests can alert athletes and coaches to potential genetic traits that could pose potential risks to athletes. Genetic tests can find markers for things such as sickle-cell trait and certain heart conditions, both of which can lead to health complications and possibly death for carriers of the genes who physically over-exert themselves.	While there is an obvious benefit to genetic testing, there are many questions of the ethics of such testing.
